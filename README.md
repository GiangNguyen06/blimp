# blimp
This is the repository of my Bachelor Thesis Project at Kexxu

For this project make sure that you know how to work with MQTT protocol as it is essential for this project.

Python scripts are to publish and using PS4 game controller DualShock4 to control a blimp.

Arduino code is essential to the movements of a whole blimp.

Updated with AruCo MQTT recogniition.

The scripts are able to calibrate the camera, and with this properly measure the distance(10% error) and ID the Aruco marker.
